# RasPi-Speech-Recognition-Project
This is a project I did for my Fall 2017 Intelligent Systems class. 
I developed a Python application that used Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API to process vocal input and print it on an external text display using an integrated Raspberry Pi unit connected to a breadboard.
The application demonstrated the use of voiced based interface to control system capabilities.
With the exception of "GarrettListenToMe.py" in "speech_recognition-master/examples/", no files in the "speech_recognition-master" folder were created by me or modified beyond use for this project.
